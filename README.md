## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:computer: Over the last six months, I dove deep into NextJs and developed e-commerce app dedicated to making high-quality products from top brands accessible to customers across Africa.  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge in Web3 and blockchain technology.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m invested in learning Ethereum and Solidity to explore blockchainâ€™s potential and smart contract development.  
:rocket: Iâ€™m getting help from Metana with deepening my blockchain expertise, especially in decentralized app (dApp) development.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on MERN stack, NextJs, and Web3 projects.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about full-stack development, MERN stack, NextJs, and my experience transitioning into Web3.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/menelik-tefera/ or menelikworku@gmail.com  
âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring the latest trends in tech and crypto or reading up on blockchain innovation!
